# A Wordle game and solver written in Python.
I wrote all of the code without looking at any examples, so there are probably way better versions out there.
But if you want to use the code or have any advise for me feel free to do so/reach out!

# How to use
-main.py          
Is a normal wordle game with infite guesses.

-solver.py        
Gives you step by step instructions on how to solve a wordle. Usualy takes 3-4 guesses.

-simulation.py    
Simulates a number of games with a given first guess and shows the average guesses it took to solve.
